# ðŸ§  Enneagram Personality Test App

This is a personality test application based on the **Enneagram of Personality**, a powerful model used to understand human behavior and core motivations. The test determines which of the **9 Enneagram types** best describes you, and also explores your **wings** (adjacent influences).

## ðŸ“Œ What is the Enneagram?

The Enneagram is a psychological and spiritual personality system that divides human personality into **nine core types**, each with its own unique strengths, fears, and patterns of thinking. These types are:

1. The Reformer (The Idealist)
2. The Helper (The Giver)
3. The Achiever (The Performer)
4. The Individualist (The Romantic)
5. The Investigator (The Observer)
6. The Loyalist (The Guardian)
7. The Enthusiast (The Adventurer)
8. The Challenger (The Protector)
9. The Peacemaker (The Mediator)

Each type can also be influenced by one of its neighboring types, called **wings**, creating more nuance in your personality profile (e.g., 4w5 or 4w3).
